# Personal Portfolio – Efrén De Dios Miramontes

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

The goal of this project is to present who I am, showcase my projects, and share my skills as a web development student. It also serves as a space where I can experiment, improve my frontend abilities, and build a professional online presence.

##  About Me

I’m Efrén, a student of Information and Communication Technologies Engineering with a focus on web development.

I mainly work with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, building simple and functional web applications that solve specific problems. My objective is to join a team as a **junior web developer**, continue learning, and contribute value from day one.

---

##  Projects

Each project displayed on the portfolio represents a learning process.

When clicking on a project card, a modal window opens showing:

* The problem the project aims to solve
* What I learned during development
* Technologies used
* A direct link to the GitHub repository

This approach allows visitors to understand not only the final result, but also the reasoning and growth behind each project.

---

##  Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* PHP (basic usage)

---

##  Design Approach

The current design is intentionally simple.

My focus is on:

* Clear structure
* Readability
* Responsiveness
* Gradual improvement over time

Future updates will include:

* Custom project cover designs
* Improved visual identity
* Better animations and interactions

---

##  Project Status

This portfolio is **actively evolving**.
I plan to continuously refactor, improve design decisions, and add new projects as I grow as a developer.
